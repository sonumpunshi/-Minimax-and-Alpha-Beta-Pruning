# -Minimax-and-Alpha-Beta-Pruning

This project involves creating an intelligent agent to play a modified version of the Nim game, termed "red-blue nim," against a human player. The game features two piles of marbles, red and blue, and players alternate turns removing a marble from one pile. The winner is the player who, on their turn, finds one or both piles empty. The winning score is determined by the number of marbles left in the non-empty pile, with red marbles worth 2 points and blue marbles worth 3 points.

Implemented the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning to determine the best move for the computer player. The computer player evaluates potential moves to maximize its score while minimizing the human player's score.
